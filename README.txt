To automatically test your implementation, unzip the TestCases.zip file somewhere on your computer.

Run the following command

python testing.py "C:/path/to/unzippedtestcases" "C:/path/to/yourcode"

The script will print a list with the grade on each test case (out of 10) and the overall grade for all test cases as a percentage. For any failed test cases, it will print a reason why. 

In order to run this, ensure you have the following packages installed through your package manager:
numpy
scipy
pandas
